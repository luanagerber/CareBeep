### About
CareBeep was designed and developed to help people communicate with their caregivers. 
With CareBeep you can carry out more everyday activities on your own, knowing that just 3 taps on the screen can call for help at any time. Your caregivers will also benefit from being able to resume their activities with greater peace of mind. With a simple and intuitive interface, you can request help at any time using pictograms, indicating where you are and what you need. Your caregivers will be notified immediately.<br>
